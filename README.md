    Here i am writing a function that is going to change dash-separated words into camelCased words
# Pseudocode
    - split the statement into an array
    - Iterate through the array(use map method) 
    - to convert each letter at the begininng of the word into uppercase (use to uppercase string method)
    - join the array back into a single statement (using join method)
